# Purpose: These functions allow one to easily save network credentials to disk in a relatively
# secure manner. The resulting on-disk credential file can only [1] be decrypted
# by the same user account which performed the encryption. For more details, see
# the help files for ConvertFrom-SecureString and ConvertTo-SecureString as well as
# MSDN pages about Windows Data Protection API.
# [1]: So far as I know today. Next week I'm sure a script kiddie will break it.
#
# Usage: Export-PSCredential [-Credential <PSCredential object>] [-Path <file to export>]
# Export-PSCredential [-Credential <username>] [-Path <file to export>]
# If Credential is not specififed, user is prompted by Get-Credential cmdlet.
# If a username is specified, then Get-Credential will prompt for password.
# If the Path is not specififed, it will default to "./credentials.enc.xml".
# Output: FileInfo object referring to saved credentials
#
# Import-PSCredential [-Path <file to import>]
#
# If not specififed, Path is "./credentials.enc.xml".
# Output: PSCredential object
